# CloudWire — Features

A complete overview of what CloudWire does and what you can do with it.

---

## Core concept

CloudWire connects to your AWS account, discovers resources across the services you choose, and draws them as an interactive graph in your browser. Each node is an AWS resource. Each edge is a real relationship — an event trigger, a queue subscription, an API integration, a database connection.

The result is a live map of how your infrastructure is actually wired together.

---

## Scanning

### Multi-service scanning
Select any combination of AWS services to scan in a single pass. CloudWire scans all selected services in parallel and builds the graph as results come in — you don't wait for one service to finish before the next starts.

### Real-time progress
A progress bar tracks how many services have been scanned. The graph populates live as each service completes — you can start exploring before the full scan finishes.

### Quick and Deep scan modes
- **Quick** — lists resources only. Fast, low API call volume, results cached for 5 minutes.
- **Deep** — describes each resource individually for richer attribute data. Slower but more detailed, cached for 30 minutes.

### Scan caching
Scanning the same region and services twice within the cache window returns the previous result instantly. No redundant API calls, no waiting.

### Stop mid-scan
Cancel a running scan at any time. Resources already discovered are kept on the graph — you don't lose what was found before you stopped.

### Multi-region support
Scan any of the 29 supported AWS regions. CloudFront distributions are global and always included regardless of region.

## Graph visualization

### Interactive canvas
Pan, zoom, and drag the canvas freely. The graph supports thousands of nodes without performance degradation through viewport virtualization — only nodes visible in the current view are rendered.

### Three layout modes
- **Circular** — nodes grouped by service in circular clusters. Good for getting an overview of what exists.
- **Flow** — hierarchical top-to-bottom layout following data flow direction. Good for tracing how requests move through your system.
- **Swimlane** — nodes arranged in horizontal lanes by service. Good for comparing resources across services side by side.

Switch between layouts at any time without re-scanning.

### Node detail levels
The graph adapts to zoom level:
- **Zoomed out far** — nodes render as small colored dots for a high-level overview
- **Zoomed out** — nodes show icons only, no labels
- **Normal** — nodes show service icon, resource name, service type label, and role badge
- **Zoomed in** — full detail including educational tooltip on hover

### Resource state indicators
Nodes for services that expose resource state (EC2, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, CloudFront) show a colored status dot:
- **Green** — active / running / available
- **Red** — failed / error / disabled
- **Amber** — transitional state (starting, stopping, updating)

### Role badges
Each node is automatically classified with a functional role based on what it does in a cloud architecture:
- **TRIGGER** — event sources (API Gateway, EventBridge, SNS)
- **PROC** — compute and processing (Lambda, ECS, Step Functions, Glue)
- **STORE** — data storage (DynamoDB, RDS, S3, ElastiCache)
- **QUEUE** — message queuing (SQS, Kinesis)

### Minimap
A thumbnail overview in the corner shows the full graph and your current viewport position. Click anywhere on the minimap to jump to that area instantly.

## Exploring relationships

### Blast radius highlighting
Select any node and toggle blast radius mode to highlight everything connected to it:
- **Orange** — upstream dependencies (what this resource depends on)
- **Cyan** — downstream dependents (what depends on this resource)

Instantly answers "if this Lambda goes down, what else breaks?" or "what feeds into this queue?"

### Path finder
Select a source and destination node to find the shortest connection path between them. CloudWire traces the route through the graph and highlights every hop along the way.

### Focus mode
Narrow the graph to show only a selected node and its immediate neighbors. Adjust the hop depth (1, 2, or 3 hops) to control how much context you see. Everything outside the focus is faded out.

### Flow animation
Animate data flow along graph edges to visualize the direction traffic moves through your architecture.

---

## Filtering and search

### Search
Type in the search bar to filter nodes by resource ID or name. Results update as you type. Shows the first 120 matches with a count indicator if more exist.

### Service visibility toggles
Show or hide entire services from the graph with one click. Useful for decluttering when you've scanned many services but only care about a subset.

### Isolated node toggle
Nodes with no connections to other scanned services are hidden by default to keep the graph clean. Toggle "Show isolated" to reveal them. When all nodes in a scan are isolated (e.g. scanning only SQS), they're shown automatically.

### Clustering
When a service has many resources, they're automatically collapsed into a single cluster node showing a count. Expand or collapse individual service clusters from the sidebar.

## Resource inspector

Click any node to open the inspector panel on the right. It shows:

- **Resource ID** and ARN
- **Service type** and region
- **All attributes** returned by the AWS API — instance type, runtime, table class, status, tags, and more
- **Incoming edges** — what calls or triggers this resource
- **Outgoing edges** — what this resource calls or writes to

---

## Architecture summary

Generate an automatic architecture summary for the scanned graph. The summary describes the overall pattern (event-driven, request-response, data pipeline, etc.), lists the services involved, and highlights key relationships — useful for documentation or onboarding new team members.

## Privacy and security

- **All data stays local.** Nothing is sent to any external server. The graph is built in memory on your machine and served only to your local browser.
- **Read-only AWS access.** CloudWire never creates, modifies, or deletes any AWS resources. It only calls List and Describe APIs.
- **Credentials never leave your terminal.** AWS credentials are read from your local credential chain and used only to make API calls to AWS directly.
- **Runs on localhost only.** The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and is never exposed to your network.

## Works with every AWS auth method

CloudWire reads credentials from the standard AWS credential chain. Any tool that writes to `~/.aws/credentials` works automatically:

| Tool | How to use |
|------|-----------|
| AWS CLI profiles | `cloudwire --profile my-profile` |
| AWS SSO | `aws sso login` then `cloudwire --profile my-profile` |
| saml2aws | `saml2aws login` then `cloudwire` |
| aws-vault | `aws-vault exec my-profile -- cloudwire` |
| Environment variables | Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` etc., then `cloudwire` |
| EC2/ECS instance role | Just run `cloudwire` — credentials are picked up automatically |
