# cloudwire

Scan your AWS account and visualize resource dependencies as an interactive graph — directly in your browser, running entirely on your local machine.

No data leaves your system. AWS credentials never leave your terminal. The graph is built locally using your existing credential chain (`~/.aws/credentials`, `aws sso login`, `saml2aws`, `aws-vault` — all work out of the box).

---

## Install

```bash
pip install cloudwire
cloudwire
```

That's it. The browser opens automatically at `http://localhost:8080`.

> **Requirements:** Python 3.9+ and valid AWS credentials configured locally.

---

## What it looks like

- Dark hacker-aesthetic graph canvas
- Nodes represent AWS resources — Lambda functions, SQS queues, API Gateways, RDS instances, S3 buckets, and more
- Edges represent relationships and data flow between resources
- Click any node to inspect its attributes and connected resources
- Search, filter by service, highlight upstream/downstream blast radius

## Contributing

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (3.11 recommended)
- Node.js 18+
- AWS credentials configured (any method)

### Set up the dev environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hisingh_gwre/cloudwire
cd cloudwire

# Python
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install
```

### Run in development mode

```bash
make dev
```

This starts the FastAPI backend on `:8000` (with `--reload`) and the Vite dev server on `:5173` concurrently. The Vite dev server proxies all `/api/*` requests to the backend — no CORS config needed.

### Making changes

| Area | Where to edit |
|------|--------------|
| Add a new AWS service scanner | `cloudwire/app/scanner.py` → add a `_scan_<service>` method and register it in `self.service_scanners` |
| Change graph layout | `frontend/src/lib/graphTransforms.js` |
| Add a new UI component | `frontend/src/components/` |
| Change API routes | `cloudwire/app/main.py` — all routes are under the `/api` prefix |
| Change CLI options | `cloudwire/cli.py` |

### Before opening a PR

- Run a scan against a real (or mocked) AWS account and confirm the graph renders
- Make sure `make build` completes without errors
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR

### Code style

- Python: standard library imports first, then third-party, then local. No formatter enforced yet.
- JavaScript: no linter enforced yet. Match the style of the surrounding file.
